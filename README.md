# liri-node-app
The liri node app is a way to search concerts near you returning their date and location, search songs and return the album where its from and a preview link, and search a movie and return information like its rating, length, and plot.

The app is organized by the required node packages at top along with links to needed tools like keys for the api's.
Then it takes in user input and asigns that into variables for later use.
Then it uses a switch case to allow for different function use based off keyword user input.
Then all of the functions are written.

To use the app you need to initialize the app and get the node packages that are required to run the program, and then put into the terminal,
node liri concert-this <concert name>
node liri spotify-this-song <song name>
node liri movie-this <movie name>
node liri do-what-it-says <command name>
